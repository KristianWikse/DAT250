# Laboratory report

### Technical Problems

__Installation__
* Forgot to add PATH variable for maven bin folder. Windows powershell could therfore not find the mvn commands. This problem was quickly fixed. 


__Testing and compiling__
* Mvn clean install could not delete my .jar extension file which meant that the original getting started project would not get modified. 

### Validation

__Running on the Web__
* No problem occured following the instructions given in the tutorial. 

__Running Locally__
* Worked until I tried to modify the original code. 

### Pending issues

Could not solve the problem with the .jar file within the given timeframe.
